# RecursiveInterp

Recursive interpolation in JavaScript

Recursive Interplation is a linear interpolation between
elements, where the elements may be either numbers or
interpolation objects. Interpolation in this form is flexible,
but it can be difficult to evaluate the quality of the interpolation.
This repository will investigate the use of graph visualization techniques to examine the grid quality.
